                        I was born on October 3rd, 1997. That day the hospital was so full of labor moms that they had to sent my mom to another hospital, thats why I know multiple people whos birthday is the same is mine (even a cousin!). I have lived my entire life in Tibas,
                        San José and have only traveled to Panamá (I also have a Panamanian citizenchip, because of my mom).

                    <h4>Many years looking for my "calling"</h4>
                    <p>
                        In 2014 I graduated highschool; really not having an idea on what to study I got into Universidad Nacional (UNA) in a new career called "Ingenieria en Bioprocesos Industriales", since I was very good in math and science. Turns out I never felt that was
                        my "calling". So on 2017 I decided to get a second career, still looking for like my "destined career", I took a very stupid decition that was getting in med school (to be fair, I really thought it was a great idea in that time).
                        On 2019 I started med school on UCR, while finishing my other career, it kind of work until.... <span>COVID</span>, thats right. Starting the most difficult year of med school, Covid started and everything
                        shut down, it was a dissaster (med school on zoom? I think not!). Fast forward I took the most intelligent decition during a pandemic, getting married :); my now husband, a Back-end developer who loves Python saw my endless suffering
                        in med school and got me on a online school called Platzi to learn programming, so I discovered the world of HTML and JS. I'm far from being a professional but really think that I'm very good at it!

                        That time my pajamas went viral
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        I ended my first career on 2019, my graduation was supposed to be on 2020 but.... Yes, you got it right, Covid again. So all the diplomas were sent via mail. Instead of a fancy graduation, we got a mail worker deliver our diplomas. One day, as I was falling
                        asleep in my biochemistry class, the mail guy decided to arrive. I was far from ready, I was still on my pajamas! But went out to "graduate" anyway. My mom decided to capture the moment with a photo, a photo that I decided to post
                        on my Twitter because it was funny! Little did i knew, the post went viral, with over 260k likes and 16k shares on Twitter, my photo were in the news and became a meme.
